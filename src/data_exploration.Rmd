Here, we are going to start trying to look at the data and see where that goes. 

```{r read in files}
asvs_counts = read_tsv(here("data", "ASVs_counts.tsv"))
```

```{r}
asvs_taxonomy = read_tsv(here("data", "ASVs_taxonomy.tsv"))
```

```{r}
Metadata = read_csv(here("data", "Narragansett_Metadata.txt"))
```
